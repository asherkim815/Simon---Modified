This project came from a Udemy course by Angela Yu, The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp.

I modified it the following way:

1. Replaced jQuery with Javascript
2. Shortened the codes by removing unused HTML and CSS codes
3. Used flexbox
4. Added "document.activeElement.blur();" to prevent the space bar from "clicking" after a click
5. Replaced deprecated keypress with keyup
